Check for v0.3.1


+ updated translations
- check incinerator (not too good)

--------------------
--- DONE v0.3.2 ----

--- DONE v0.3.0 ----
--------------------

! fixed minable_results not consistent by factorio (manual vs automatic mining -> storage_slots)
! fixed Localization for changed recipes (metal-scrap)
+ properly ordered recipes + items into correct subgroups
+ landfill recipes changed
  -> burning landfill takes a lot more time
+ balancing gravel/dirt output -> 
  -> dirt can now be dried which creates less amount of dried dirt
+ fixed icons for slag/sludge processing
+ pulverizer: coal -> coal dust, sulfur -> sulfur-dust
+ coal field -> coal dust, coal
+ improving Incinerator
- steel-dust (from coal-dust + pulverized-iron) gives cheaper steel
- expensive recipes produce metal-scrap as byproduct (only for placeable items)
- dirt texture (fixed o, u transition. U is not perfect aligned yet)
- all furnaces support hardCrafting smelting recipes (2 output slots)
